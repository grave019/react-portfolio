        Hello there my name is Brent Graves. I graduated from the University of Alabama with Bachelors of Science degree in Biology. During my education I spent several years doing research in organic chemistry and genetics. This cultivated a love for learning and integrating new technologies into my work.

        For the last 8 years I have managed overseeing the collection of 12 million dollars of accounts recievable overseeing 5 collectors at Wayne's Auto Sales in Birmingham, Alabama. I recently moved to Orlando, Florida. After 9 years at Waynes Auto Sales, I decided on a career change that would challenge my creativity and intellect. I enrolled in University of Central Florida's Coding Bootcamp. My life experience has prepared me for any challenges that I may face. I believe I will be an asset to your team and look forward to working with you.
