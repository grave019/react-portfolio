        Hello there my name is Brent Graves. I graduated from the University of Alabama with Bachelors of Science degree in Biology. During my education I spent several years doing research in organic chemistry and genetics. This cultivated a love for learning and integrating new technologies into my work.

        For the last 8 years I have managed overseeing the collection of 12 million dollars of accounts recievable overseeing 5 collectors at Wayne's Auto Sales in Birmingham, Alabama. I recently moved to Orlando, Florida. After 9 years at Waynes Auto Sales, I decided on a career change that would challenge my creativity and drive me to learn new technologies. I am currently a full stack web developer. I am looking for a company that will allow me to grow my skills and knowledge.
